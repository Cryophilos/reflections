When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working in a team or with different computers, or for safekeeping.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It would take too much bandwidth to pull all commits made by other collaborators.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branches create alternates commit paths inside a repository.
	clones create a copy of an existing repository
	forks clone a repository on github from someone's account to your own with a link to the original creator
	branch are within your own project, clonex are for altering someone's project without changing the original, forks are the same but with attribution
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	it can serve as a reference point to see how far ahead of the remote you are, and how soon you should push your changes.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	without git or github cooperation would be done through email and sending copies to different collaborators.
	the main problems is that the conflicts and changes would have to be found and entered manually.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	when working in a group, making changes in a side branch makes pull requests easier.
