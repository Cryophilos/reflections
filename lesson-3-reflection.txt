When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working in a team or with different computers, or for safekeeping.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It would take too much bandwidth to pull all commits made by other collaborators.
