When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working in a team or with different computers, or for safekeeping.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It would take too much bandwidth to pull all commits made by other collaborators.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branches create alternates commit paths inside a repository.
	clones create a copy of an existing repository
	forks clone a repository on github from someone's account to your own with a link to the original creator
	branch are within your own project, clonex are for altering someone's project without changing the original, forks are the same but with attribution
